OK OK OK

You got the LeafletMap element to render!  Just from poking around!  Good job!!

What's next?

Assignment is to:
  - get the map to render portland
  - have tests passing
  - maybe pass data in to the map through props

So!  Let's break that down.

First priority is getting the map to render.  Getting it to render PDX shouldn't be a huge issue since it's just a lat and long thatcha just slap right on in there.  Just, mm.  Hardcoded.

Try playing around some more with the LeafletMap story, and compare it to Button and StoryCard.  Those are good.

Just see how it's already been done, then try to imitate it.  Easy peasy, just takes focus and time.

You can do this! ðŸŽ‰
